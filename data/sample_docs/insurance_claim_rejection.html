        <h1>Insurance Claim Rejection - What to Do</h1>
        
        <h2>Understanding Claim Rejection</h2>
        <p>According to IRDAI regulations, insurance companies must provide clear reasons for claim rejection. Common reasons include incomplete documentation, policy exclusions, or non-disclosure of material facts.</p>
        
        <h2>Steps After Rejection</h2>
        <p>People typically start by carefully reviewing the rejection letter to understand the specific reasons cited by the insurer. The letter should clearly state which policy clause or regulation was the basis for rejection.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Review the Rejection Letter</h3>
        <p>The rejection letter typically contains:
        <ul>
            <li>Specific reason for rejection</li>
            <li>Policy clause reference</li>
            <li>Documents required (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Timeline for appeal</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. Gather Supporting Documents</h3>
        <p>Common documents needed for appeal include:
        <ul>
            <li>Original policy document</li>
            <li>Claim form and acknowledgment</li>
            <li>All correspondence with insurer</li>
            <li>Medical reports (for health insurance)</li>
            <li>Police FIR (for vehicle insurance)</li>
            <li>Bills and receipts</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Filing an Appeal</h2>
        <p>Insurance companies usually have an internal grievance redressal mechanism. Many people find it helpful to file a formal appeal with the insurance company within 30 days of receiving the rejection notice.</p>
        
        <h3>Appeal Process</h3>
        <p>The appeal should include:
        <ul>
            <li>Written explanation addressing rejection reasons</li>
            <li>Additional supporting documents</li>
            <li>Reference to policy terms</li>
            <li>Request for reconsideration</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Insurance Ombudsman</h2>
        <p>If the internal appeal is unsuccessful, regulations typically allow policyholders to approach the Insurance Ombudsman. This is a free service provided by IRDAI.</p>
        
        <h3>Ombudsman Eligibility</h3>
        <p>People can approach the Ombudsman when:
        <ul>
            <li>Claim amount is up to Rs. 50 lakhs</li>
            <li>Internal appeal was rejected or no response within 30 days</li>
            <li>Complaint is filed within one year of final rejection</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>How to File with Ombudsman</h3>
        <p>The process typically involves:
        <ul>
            <li>Submit complaint online or by post</li>
            <li>Attach all relevant documents</li>
            <li>Include internal appeal rejection letter</li>
            <li>Wait for hearing date (usually within 3 months)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>According to IRDAI guidelines:
        <ul>
            <li>Insurance companies typically respond to appeals within 30 days</li>
            <li>Ombudsman usually resolves cases within 3 months</li>
            <li>Award is binding on insurance company</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Consumer Court</h2>
        <p>If Ombudsman decision is unsatisfactory, people often consider consumer court. This is typically recommended when:
        <ul>
            <li>Claim amount exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs</li>
            <li>Seeking compensation beyond claim amount</li>
            <li>Complex legal issues involved</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
